          Hello! My name is Sam. FileMaker development specialist with over 7  years experience providing custom FileMaker database
          solutions that deliver efficiency. 
          
          I have designed and implemented systems for the call centre, insurance industry, education consulting industry, printing industry and recruiting industry. I am always looking to expand the skills and
          knowledge I have, along with learning new industries with the aim of advancing my long-term profession.
          
          From FileMaker version 16 through to the most resent release, I have maintained my standing as a
          FileMaker Certified Developer. Also, I am keen on developing new skills by studying Javascript, Swift and attended a number of Developer Conferences over the years to keep my knowledge up to date.
